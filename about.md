## About

I'm a Software Developer with 4 years of industry experience, and it includes a
Summer internship with [VMware](https://vmware.com) and 3.5 years at a
Microsoft-backed Big Data start-up named [Germin8](https://www.germin8.com).
I currently pursue the Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles. I love contributing to eminent Open Source
projects in my free time, and, so far, I've contributed to 20+ projects (like
Spring Boot, Spring Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) on [GitHub](https://github.com/venilnoronha).
I've also donated one of my projects, [Spring Cloud Config Server MongoDB](https://github.com/spring-cloud-incubator/spring-cloud-config-server-mongodb),
to Pivotal's Spring Cloud Incubator.

I get pretty excited on hearing words like Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing,
Microservices, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, High Availability and Software 
Architecture. I'm also extremely enthusiastic about Open Source Software, so if
you have a cool idea and are looking for someone to collaborate with, feel free
to hit me up.
