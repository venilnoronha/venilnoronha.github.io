Hi, I’m Venil Noronha, a software engineer with a passion for distributed
systems and software architecture. I have a decade of industry experience in
topics ranging service mesh, microservices, distributed systems, software
design, platform engineering, and cloud computing. I enjoy contributing to open
source projects and sharing my knowledge with the community.

Currently, I work at [Stripe, Inc.][stripe], one of the leading payment
platforms in the world. There, I'm building innovative products for online
payments, and have also worked on the service mesh and service discovery
platforms that power Stripe’s infrastructure. Before joining Stripe, I was a
senior engineer at [VMware, Inc.][vmware], where I led several projects for the
[Tanzu Service Mesh][tsm] product. Prior to that, I developed SaaS products at
[Germin8][germin8], a Microsoft-backed social media analytics startup in Mumbai.

I love contributing to open source projects and really enjoy speaking at
[technology conferences][conferences]. I’ve contributed to projects like Spring 
Boot, Spring Cloud, gRPC, Golang, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, etc. on
[GitHub][github]. I’ve been a maintainer of subprojects in the [Istio][istio]
and [Envoy][envoy] communities, and I’ve donated one of my projects,
[Spring Cloud Config Server MongoDB][spring], to Pivotal’s Spring Cloud
Incubator. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of 
Southern California, and a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from the
University of Mumbai.

If you want to chat with me about anything related to these topics or just say
hi, feel free to email me at hello AT venilnoronha DOT io.
