I'm a software engineer with over 8 years of industry experience in building
cloud-based, distributed systems, and microservices. I'm currently focused on
building payment products at [Stripe, Inc.][stripe], and I previously also
contributed to Stripe's service mesh and service discovery platforms. I like
contributing to open source projects like [Envoy][envoy] and [Istio][istio],
and I really enjoy speaking at [technology conferences][talks]. Prior to joining
Stripe, I lead a few projects for the [Tanzu Service Mesh][tsm] product at
[VMware, Inc.][vmware] Before VMware, I developed SaaS products for a
Microsoft-backed social media analytics startup in Bombay (Mumbai) called
[Germin8][g8].

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern
California, and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the
University of Mumbai. I love contributing to open source projects in my free
time, and I've previously contributed to projects like Spring Boot, Spring
Cloud, gRPC, Golang, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, etc. on [GitHub][github]. I've been
a maintainer of a few subprojects in the Istio and Envoy communities, and I've
donated one of my projects, [Spring Cloud Config Server MongoDB][spring], to
Pivotal's Spring Cloud Incubator.
