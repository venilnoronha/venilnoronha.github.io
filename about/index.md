I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of industry experience in building
cloud software. I currently work with the [Tanzu Service Mesh](https://pages.cloud.vmware.com/vmware-nsx-service-mesh)
product team at [VMware, Inc.](https://www.vmware.com) I also contribute
upstream to projects like [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) and [Envoy proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy).
Previously, I worked with the Open Source Technology Center at VMware after
doing a couple of internships with VMware's Storage and Availability business
unit. I also developed SaaS products for a Microsoft-backed Big Data startup in
Bombay (Mumbai) named [Germin8](https://germin8.com).

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern
California, and a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the
University of Mumbai. I love contributing to open source projects in my free
time, and, so far, I've contributed to 25+ projects (like Istio, Envoy proxy,
gRPC, Golang, Kubernetes, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Kafka, RabbitMQ,
etc.) on [GitHub](https://github.com/venilnoronha). I maintain a few subprojects
under Istio and Envoy proxy, and I'm a member of the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes)
project. I've also donated one of my projects, [Spring Cloud Config Server MongoDB](https://github.com/spring-cloud-incubator/spring-cloud-config-server-mongodb),
to Pivotal's Spring Cloud Incubator.

I'm very passionate about Service Mesh, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing,
Microservices, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, High Availability and Software
Architecture. I'm also greatly enthusiastic about Open Source Software, so if
you have a cool idea and are looking for someone to collaborate with, feel free
to hit me up on hello AT venilnoronha DOT io.
