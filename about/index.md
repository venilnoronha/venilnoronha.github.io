I'm a software engineer with over 7 years of industry experience in building
cloud-based, distributed systems, and microservices. I currently work with the
Service Networking team for Traffic Engineering at [Stripe, Inc.][stripe] I also
contribute to open source projects like [Envoy][envoy] and [Istio][istio], and I
really enjoy speaking at [technology conferences][talks]. Prior to joining
Stripe, I was leading a few projects for the [Tanzu Service Mesh][tsm] product
at [VMware, Inc.][vmware] Before VMware, I was developing SaaS products for a
Microsoft-backed Big Data startup in Bombay (Mumbai) named [Germin8][g8].

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern
California, and a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the
University of Mumbai. I love contributing to open source projects in my free
time, and I've previously contributed to projects like Spring Boot, Spring
Cloud, gRPC, Golang, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, etc. on [GitHub][github]. I maintain
a few subprojects in the Istio and Envoy communities, and I've donated one of my
projects, [Spring Cloud Config Server MongoDB][spring], to Pivotal's Spring
Cloud Incubator.
