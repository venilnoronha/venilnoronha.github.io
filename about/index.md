I'm a Software Developer with over 4 years of industry experience in building
cloud products. I currently work with the Open Source Technology Center at
VMware, Inc. where I primarily contribute upstream to projects like
[Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) and [Envoy Proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy).
Previously, I doubly interned with VMware, Inc. and developed software for a
Microsoft-backed Big Data startup in Bombay (Mumbai) named [Germin8](https://germin8.com).

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern
California, and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the University
of Mumbai. I love contributing to eminent Open Source projects in my free time,
and, so far, I've contributed to 25+ projects (like Golang, Kubernetes, Spring Boot,
Spring Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) on [GitHub](https://github.com/venilnoronha). I'm
a member of [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes), [Istio](https://github.com/istio)
and [Envoy Proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy). I've also donated one of my
projects, [Spring Cloud Config Server MongoDB](https://github.com/spring-cloud-incubator/spring-cloud-config-server-mongodb),
to Pivotal's Spring Cloud Incubator.

I'm very passionate about Service Mesh, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing,
Microservices, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, High Availability and Software
Architecture. I'm also greatly enthusiastic about Open Source Software, so if
you have a cool idea and are looking for someone to collaborate with, feel free
to hit me up on hello AT venilnoronha DOT io.
