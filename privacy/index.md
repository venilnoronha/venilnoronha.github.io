#### How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll, Google Analytics, Disqus, and is hosted on
GitHub with Cloudflare as a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Github, like any
hosting company, can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP
addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile
visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

#### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party
cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the
power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses
and use SSL at all times. Please refer to the
[Google privacy policy][google-policy] for details.

#### Disqus

This website uses Disqus for comments. This happens only if you approve third
party cookies and scripts, and the comments have been enabled for a particular
page. Please refer to the [Disqus privacy policy][disqus-policy] for details.
You may additionally specifically opt out via Disqus's
[data sharing settings][disqus-settings].
