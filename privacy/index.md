#### How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub, with Cloudflare as a
Content Delivery Network (CDN). Github, like any hosting company, can have full
insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note
that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can
(try to) prevent this.

#### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party
cookies and scripts. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the
power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses
and use SSL at all times.
